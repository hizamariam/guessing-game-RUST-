This is a simple number guessing game built in Rust where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The game tracks the number of guesses and time taken, allowing you to compare your performance to previous attempts.

Features:
Choose between three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
Track your best score (lowest guesses and fastest time).
Play again as many times as you like.
How to Play:
Choose a difficulty level:

Easy (1–50)
Medium (1–100)
Hard (1–200)
Try to guess the randomly generated number. You will receive hints if your guess is too high or too low.

The game will track the number of guesses and the time taken to find the correct answer.

After winning, you can check if you have set a new high score.

Optionally, you can play again after completing a game.
